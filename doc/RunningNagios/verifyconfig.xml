    <title>Verifying Your Configuration</title>

    <para>Every time you modify your <xref
    linkend="configuringnagios-config" />, you should run a sanity check on
    them. It is important to do this before you (re)start Shinken, as Shinken
    will shut down if your configuration contains errors.</para>

    <para>In order to verify your configuration, run Shinken-arbiter with the
    <option>-v</option> command line option like so:</para>

    <screen>
<prompt>linux:~ # </prompt><userinput>/usr/local/shinken/src/shinken-arbiter -v /usr/local/shinken/src/etc/nagios.cfg</userinput>
</screen>

    <para>If you've forgotten to enter some critical data or misconfigured
    things, Shinken will spit out a warning or error message that should point
    you to the location of the problem. Error messages generally print out the
    line in the configuration file that seems to be the source of the problem.
    On errors, Shinken will exit the pre-flight check. If you get any error
    messages you'll need to go and edit your configuration files to remedy the
    problem. Warning messages can generally be safely ignored, since they are
    only recommendations and not requirements.</para>

    <para>Once you've verified your configuration files and fixed any errors
    you can go ahead and <link linkend="runningnagios-startstop">(re)start
    Shinken</link>.</para>
