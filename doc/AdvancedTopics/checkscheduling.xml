    <para>The scheduling of Shinken is quite simple. The first scheduling take care of the max_service_check_spread and max_host_check_spread so the time of the first schedule will be in the start+max_*_check_spread*interval_length (60s in general) if the check_timeperiod is agree with it. Shinken do not take care about *_inter_check_delay_method : this is always 's' (smart) because other options are just useless for nearly everyone.</para>
    <para>It also do not care about the *_interleave_factor too : it's always 's' (smart) because the others options are also useless. The smart method is not the same than Nagios one. Nagios make a average of service by host to make it's dispatch of checks in the first check window. Shinken use a random way of doing it : the check is between t=now and t=min(t from next timeperiod, max_*_check_spread), but in a random way. So you will will have the better distribution of checks in this period, intead of the nagios one where hosts with differents number of services can be agresively checks.</para>
    <para>After this frist scheduling, the time for the next check is just t_check+check_interval if the timepriod is agree for it (or just the next time available in the timeperiod). In the future, a little random value (like few seconds) will be add for such cases.</para>
