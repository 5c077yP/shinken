    <para>Shinken is a system and network monitoring application. It watches
    hosts and services that you specify, alerting you when things go bad and
    when they get better.</para>

    <para>Shinken is a <ulink url="http://www.nagios.org">Nagios</ulink>
    reimplementation made in <ulink
    url="http://www.linux.com/">Python</ulink>, so it should work under all
    Python supported platmforms.</para>

    <para>Some of the many features of Shinken include:</para>

    <itemizedlist>

    <para>The only requirement of running Nagios is a machine running Python.
    You will probably also want to have TCP/IP configured, as most service
    checks will be performed over the network.</para>

    <para>You are not required to use the CGIs included with Nagios. However,
    if you do decide to use them, you will need to have the following software
    installed...</para>

    <orderedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>A web server (preferrably <ulink
        url="http://www.apache.org/">Apache</ulink>)</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Thomas Boutell's <ulink url="http://www.boutell.com/gd/">gd
        library</ulink> version 1.6.3 or higher (required by the <link
