== Fully compatible? ==

Not 100%, and it will never be. Some Nagios features are just useless in a Shiken architecture.

== I need to change something ? ==

From now YES, two things : the status.dat export (if you want it) and nagios.log (I think you still want it).

Theses things are now managed as "modules" by the Brokers, and are in the shinken-specific.cfg file (look at Simple-log and Status-Dat modules, and put your paths on it).

Maybe one day we will "hack" something like if there is such paths in nagios.cfg, we will create the modules in a dynamic way. If you want to help us on that, you can :)

== Ok, but how do I launch my Nagios conf with Shinken ? ==

It's simple, after launching scheduler, poller, reactionner and broker daemons (see README), you just need
to launch the Arbiter daemon with your Nagios configuration :

$ /usr/local/shinken/src/shinken-arbiter.py -c /usr/local/nagios/etc/nagios.cfg -c /usr/local/shinken/src/etc/shinken-specific.cfg

And that's all :)

Shinken arbiter can take multiples configuration file, so classic Nagios things are called by nagios.cfg, all specific things (like daemons connexions or realms) are in shinken-specific.cfg.
