== Fully compatible? ==

Not 100%, and it will never be. Some Nagios features are just useless in a Shiken architecture. For theses differences, you can look at the Shinken website : 
http://www.shinken-monitoring.org/what-is-in-shinken-not-in-nagios-and-vice-versa/

== I need to change something ? ==

No. 

There are differences between some nagios parameters and shinken way of doing :
status_file and log_file parameters are no more useful in the nagios.cfg file for Shinken. Theses things are now managed as "modules" by the Brokers, and are in the shinken-specific.cfg file (look at Simple-log and Status-Dat modules, and put your paths on it).

But hopefuly, Shinken can detect you put such parameters and will autogenerate the modules for you. (But if you can take them in the shinken-specific.cfg file, it's better...)


== Ok, but how do I launch my Nagios conf with Shinken ? ==

It's simple, after launching scheduler, poller, reactionner and broker daemons (see README), you just need
to launch the Arbiter daemon with your Nagios configuration :

$ /usr/local/shinken/src/shinken-arbiter.py -c /usr/local/nagios/etc/nagios.cfg -c /usr/local/shinken/src/etc/shinken-specific.cfg

(you can also be even more lasy and call the bin/launch_all.sh script).

And that's all :)

Shinken arbiter can take multiples configuration file, so classic Nagios things are called by nagios.cfg, all specific things (like daemons connexions or realms) are in shinken-specific.cfg.
