<p>Welcome to Check_MK Multisite - a new GUI for viewing status information
and controlling your monitoring system. Multisite is not just another GUI
for Nagios - it uses a completely new architecture and design scheme. It's
key benefits are:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is fast.</li>
<li>it is flexible.</li>
<li>It supports distributed monitoring.</li>
</ul>

<p>Multisite is completely based on
<a href="http://mathias-kettner.de/checkmk_livestatus.html">MK
Livestatus</a>, which is what makes it fast in the first place - especially
in huge installations with a large number of hosts and services. </p>

<p>User customizable <b>views</b> is what makes Multisite flexible. Customize
the builtin views or create completely own views in order to need your
demands.</p>

<p>Multisite supports distributed monitoring by allowing you to combine an
arbitrary number of Monitoring servers under a common visualisation layer,
without the need of a centralized data storage. No SQL database is needed.
No network traffic is generated due to the monitoring.</p>

<p>Please learn more about Multisite at its <a href="http://mathias-kettner.de/checkmk_multisite.html">Documentation home page</a>.</p>
