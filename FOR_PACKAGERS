Hi,

First of all : THANKS for trying to make a package of Shinken :)

I try to make the setup.py quite useful for you. It will install the shinken
librayry to the classic python way (in site-package).

You will need Python >=2.4 (for 2.4 and 2.5 you will need the multiprocessing package from http://pypi.python.org/pypi/multiprocessing/ too)

You will need the pyro lib too. It must already have a package. If not, take if from pypi (easy_install)

You should add teh shinken:shinken user first to launch the setup.py pass.

You can change the place you want to put etc and var in the file setup_parameters.cfg. You can also change
the owner of theses dir (and ALL files in them) in this file.

But WARNING (bis) : if you set a --root (example =/tmp/something) it will not update the owner of the /tc and /var directory (calling with a --root is for having all files to create a package, so you don't need changing owners).
Example when you call :
python setup.py install --root=/tmp/moncul --record=INSTALLED_FILES
You get all files to package in the file INSTALLED_FILES (and only the /tmp/moncul is changed, so it's ok for your system ;)).

The setup.py will also generate the bin/default/shinken file that will be install in /etc/default/shinken. In it, you get
all variables used by the init.d scripts. It will generate the etc and var directory with the values you give in the setup cfg file.

Then you can make the install:
python setup.py install

With the python lib + etc + var it should be ok :)

I don't know what you need exctly more, so please ask in the mailing list at
https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/shinken-devel
or directly at my email : naparuba@gmail.com

And again : thanks a lot, a tool without package is nothing :)


Jean
