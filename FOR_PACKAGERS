Hi,

First of all : THANKS for trying to make a package of Shinken :)

I try to make the setup.py quite useful for you. It will install the shinken
librayry to the classic python way (in site-package).

You will need Python >=2.6 (there are such packages for redhat5 too).

You will need the pyro lib too. It must already have a package. If not, take if from pypi (easy_install)
but WARNING : not the 4.X version! (not stable and change API...). The 3.10 is cool, take this one :)

You should add teh shinken:shinken user first to launch the setup.py pass.

You can change the place you want to put etc and var in the file setup_parameters.cfg. You can also change
the owner of theses dir (and ALL files in them) in this file.

Then you can make the install:
python setup.py install

With the python lib + etc + var it should be ok :)

I don't know what you need exctly more, so please ask in the mailing list at
https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/shinken-devel
or directly at my email : naparuba@gmail.com

And again : thanks a lot, a tool without package is nothing :)


Jean
