== Presentation Of the Shinken project ==
Hi,

Welcome in the Shinken project.

Shinken is a new implementation of Nagios in AGLv3 written in Python. The main goal of Shinken is to allow users to have a fully flexible architecture for their monitoring system that can easily scale to large environments. Shinken is backward compatible with the Nagios configuration standard and plugins. It works on any operative system and architecture that supports Python, which includes Windows and Mac OS X/Darwin.


== How to install it ==

You just need to add a shinken user (in the shinken group) on your system :
$adduser shinken

=== First way : all in a directory (ugly but quick way ;) )===
Then move the shinken directory and give it to the shinken user :
mv shinken /usr/local
chown -R shinken:shinken /usr/local/shinken

=== Second way : district directory (clean way) ===
You can install really the application by using the setup.py script. It 
will install the shinken librairy in the python path, create the
/etc/shinken and /var/lib/shinken directory (you can change them
in the setup_parameters.cfg file before launching setup.py).
Then just run :
sudo python setup.py install


For the compilation part in both way it's easy : there is no compilation part!

== Dependancies ==
The only dependancies are Python >= 2.4 and the Pyro module.

For 2.4 and 2.5 python version, you will need an additionnal package : multiprocessing from http://pypi.python.org/pypi/multiprocessing/.
Just untar and launch python setup.py install (and be sure to have installed the python-devel package too).

For Python, it should be ok with nearly all distribution.

Under ubuntu, you can grag the Pyro module with :
$ sudo apt-get install pyro

Under other distributions, you can search for it :
$ yum search pyro
And if you do not find it, you can install it from Pypi :
$ easy_install pyro

And that all folks :)


== Where is the configuration ? ==
The configuration is at /usr/local/shinken/src/etc.

The nagios.cfg, commons files are like Nagios. All Shinken specific objects (like link to daemons or realms) are in
the shinken-specific.cfg file.

== I need to change the configuration ? ==

Yes, just change the arbiter object in etc/shinken-specific.cfg, the parameter host_name should
take your machine name (hostname)

That's all (and this only thing will be changed soon).

== How to run it ==
It's easy, there is a already launch script for you :
$ /usr/local/shinken/bin/launch_all.sh
