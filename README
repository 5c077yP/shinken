== Presentation Of the Shinken project ==
Hi,

Welcome in the Shinken project.

Shinken is a new implementation of Nagios in AGPLv3 written in Python. The main goal of Shinken is to allow users to have a fully flexible architecture for their monitoring system that can easily scale to large environments. Shinken is backward compatible with the Nagios configuration standard and plugins. It works on any operative system and architecture that supports Python, which includes Windows and Mac OS X/Darwin.


== How to install it ==

You just need to add a shinken user (in the shinken group) on your system :
$adduser shinken

=== First way : all in a directory (ugly but quick way ;) )===
Then move the shinken directory and give it to the shinken user :
mv shinken /usr/local
chown -R shinken:shinken /usr/local/shinken

=== Second way : district directory (clean way) ===
You can install really the application by using the setup.py script. It
will install the shinken librairy in the python path, create the
/etc/shinken and /var/lib/shinken directory (you can change them
in the setup_parameters.cfg file before launching setup.py).
You will need the python-setuptools package for it.
Then just run :
sudo python setup.py install --install-scripts=/usr/bin/

For the compilation part in both way it's easy : there is no compilation part!

== Dependancies ==
The only dependancies are Python >= 2.4 and the Pyro module.

For 2.4 and 2.5 python version, you will need an additionnal package : multiprocessing from http://pypi.python.org/pypi/multiprocessing/.
Just untar and launch python setup.py install (and be sure to have installed the python-devel package too).

Beware : Python 2.4 and 2.5 users should not be able to use the livestatus broker module. We are working on this issue.

For Python, it should be ok with nearly all distribution.

Under ubuntu, you can grag the Pyro module with :
$ sudo apt-get install pyro

Under other distributions, you can search for it :
$ yum search pyro
And if you do not find it, you can install it from Pypi :
$ easy_install pyro

And that all folks :)


== Where is the configuration ? ==
The configuration is where you put the etc directory (in /usr/local/shinken/etc for a quick and dirty install, /etc/shinken for a clean one).

The nagios.cfg, commons files are like Nagios. All Shinken specific objects (like link to daemons or realms) are in
the shinken-specific.cfg file.

== I need to change the configuration ? ==

Nothing unless somenews hosts and services.

== How to run it ==
===Quick and dirty way ===
It's easy, there is a already launch script for you :
$ /usr/local/shinken/bin/launch_all.sh

===Clean way==
The setup.py give you some init.d scripts, let use them :)
$ /etc/init.d/shinken-scheduler start
$ /etc/init.d/shinken-poller start
$ /etc/init.d/shinken-reactionner start
$ /etc/init.d/shinken-broker start
$ /etc/init.d/shinken-arbiter start


== Known bugs ==
*The only know bug not already 'fix ok' is in the status.dat module. In fact the objects.dat file is 'shrink' after a conf reload. If so, just restart the broker too (and we take debug message if you got it of course :) ). Thanks a lot.
