The Arbiter object is a way to defined Arbiter daemons that will manage all the configuration and all the architecture of shinken like distributed monitoring and high availability. It reads the configuration, cuts it into parts (N schedulers = N parts), and then send them to all others elements. It manages the high availability part : if an element dies, it re-routes the configuration managed by this falling element to a spare one. Its other role is to receive input from users (like external commands of shinken.cmd) and send them to other elements. There can be only one active arbiter in the architecture.<br/><br/>
<br/><br/>
The Arbiter definition is optionnal. If no arbiter is defined, Shinken will “create” one for the user. There will be no high availability for the Arbiter (no spare), and will use the default port in the server where the deamon is launched.
