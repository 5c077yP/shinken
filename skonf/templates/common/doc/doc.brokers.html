The Broker object is a way to the Arbiter daemons to talk with a broker and give it link to scheduler to get jobs from. Its role is to get data from schedulers (like status) and manage them (like storing them in database). The management is done by modules. Different modules exists : export into ndo database (MySQL and Oracle backend), export to merlin database (MySQL), service-perfdata export and a couchdb export.

The Broker definition is optionnal. If no poller is defined, Shinken will “create” one for the user. There will be no high availability for it (no spare), and will use the default port in the server where the deamon is launched.
