The Poller object is a way to the Arbiter daemons to talk with a scheduler and give it hosts to manage. They are in charge of launching plugins as requested by schedulers. When the check is finished they return the result to the schedulers. There can be many pollers.
<br/><br/>
The Poller definition is optionnal. If no poller is defined, Shinken will “create” one for the user. There will be no high availability for it (no spare), and will use the default port in the server where the deamon is launched.
