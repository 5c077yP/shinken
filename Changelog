FIXES

	* Fix : (reported by : Raynald de Lahondès) for python2.7, if shell launch, do not go in shlex split pass.
	* Fix : catch an exception when deregistering Pyro. (When the scheduler was started as the only process and no communication happened
	* Fix : Add the path of the current script (ex: bin/shinken-arbiter) and ".." to the list of paths where Python looks for shinken modules.

	* Fix : if the scheduler gotthe same conf but got a wait a new one before, it do a zombie scheduler then....
	* Fix : (reported by : Hienz Michael) do not close local file in the daemon pass.
	* Fix : (Raynald de Lahondès) setup.py for bsd systems.
	* Fix : service without host will be just droped, like Nagios.
	* Fix : Nagios allow elements without contacts. Do alike.
	* Fix : add protection against adding again and again the same actions ifthe scheduler ask it, like for orphaned checks.
	* Fix : sys.path management, not far more clear and error proof
	* Fix : (reported by capibaru) add a strip pass before loading cfg files.

	*Add some LSB init.d scripts
	*Add max_plugins_output_length parameter to limit the checks output size.
	*"Hack" the old nagios parameters : now status_file and nagios_log are catched. If the user defined them, but do not defined the good broker modules, we create them "on the fly". I hope one day we will remove it...

	*Add template handling to servicedependencies
	*Add test_dependencies as the regression test
	*Less status_dat verbosity :)
