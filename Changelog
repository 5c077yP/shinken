0.2 - 06/09/2010
------------------
ENHANCEMENTS
	*New code layout
	*Installation is easy with the setup.py process (first version from Maximilien Bersoult)
	*Now compatible with Pyro 3 AND 4
	*Now compatible with Python 2.4 and 2.5 too
	*Add sticky acknowledgement. Non-permanent ack-comments are now automatically removed	
	*Add host acknowledgement and acknowledgement stickiness
	*Finished service problem acknowledgement. one more testcase
	*Add REMOVE_HOST/SVC_ACKNOWLEDGEMENT external command
	*Now broker get broks from pollers and reactionners. (Useful for Logs)
	*Give Broker a way to make broks :) (like for it's own log)
	*Add a problem/incident change states when apply. But it do not interfer with the standard check way of doing (or at least should not).
	*Add some LSB init.d scripts
	*Add max_plugins_output_length parameter to limit the checks output size.
	*"Hack" the old nagios parameters : now status_file and nagios_log are catched. If the user defined them, but do not defined the good broker modules, we create them "on the fly". I hope one day we will remove it...
	*Nested macros are managed (like USERN in ARGN macro).
	*Add a pass about changing Nagios2 properties to Nagios3 ones.
	*Add json outputformat to the livestatus module
	*Add a broker module npcdmod (plus test_npcdmod) which writes a perfdata file suitable for pnp4nagios
	*Add check_period implicitly inheritate to service from host.
	*Redesign of the notifications (far easier to understand than the old async way)
	*Notice about unused parameters and explain why it can be removed from conf.
	*Catch non standard return code in actions.py so we can add stderr to the output for such cases.
	*Now arbiter host_name property is not mandatory. But WARNING : for a multiple arbiter conf, it must be set.
	*Updated cfg documentation (Author: Luke L <lukehasnoname@gmail.com>)
	*Add documentation about date range format because it was not documented.
	*Update the nagios to shinken migration file
	*Change the way broks are send from Arbiter to Broker : before, the Broker connect to the Arbiter, take broks like for schedulers. But Arbiter also connect to broker. That's a nightmare about hangout. Now, Arbiter push the broks. It's far more easy and efficient.
	*Add template handling to servicedependencies
	*Add test_dependencies as the regression test
	*Less status_dat verbosity :)
	*Add a last_perf_data + macros to access last perfdatas as in https://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/shinken/ticket/76
	*HUGE clean on shinken-specific.cfg file.
	*Add a README file
	*Add a little note about how migrate from Nagios to Shinken
	*Add a hint about how solve 'cannot find my own arbiter' error message.
	*Add bin directory with some bash scripts to launch/stop the whole application.
	*Relative path, now we can have a easy portable sample configuration. (Gerhard)
	*Add two missing operators in livestatus.py
	*Big clean up conf sample!
	*No more modulespath need in brokerd.ini. Will be easier for packagers.
	*Acknowledgement test cases
	*Add some hard tests about timeperiods calculations
	*Add a test.sh script for Hudson test (launch all tests)
	*Add a problem/impact test.
	*Now external modules can return objects (from now nobody use it, but it can be useful in the future)
	*Make easier to raise checks/notificatiosn from in deep objects class.
	*repository cosmetics (Luke L)
